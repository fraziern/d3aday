# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

### Enabling comments (via Disqus)

# Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post.

# To enable it, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

# ```yaml
#   disqus:
#     shortname: my_disqus_shortname
# ```

# You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

# Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

# If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.
